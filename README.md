# DIARIUM desktop app

Diary electron app written in Svelte.  
All data is stored in a sqlite DB on the user's computer and no backend is involved!

This is the successor of my [web-based DIARIUM](https://github.com/mriot/diarium) app.

ðŸ“¢ **This project is currently stalling due to lack of time (as of Dec 2022) but I plan to continue my work on this.**
